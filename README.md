# Terraform-projects
Terraform is one the tool that I really like from hashicorp. There are quite a few times that I see demands for create infrastructure automation for different cloud service providers in my career as DevOps Engineer. All cloud services providers have service/tool that allows you to do automation on their own cloud. Terraform fill the gap by allows you to describe your infrastructure needs in one language among all the clouds.
This repo contains some of the Terraform modules that I created. Feel free to use the code for your own project if you like my approach or get some 
inspiration from it :)
